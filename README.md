## Guess-it 
 This README provides an overview of a program that takes a number as input and prints out a range for the next number to be provided. The program is designed to provide guidance for the expected input based on the previous number provided.
                
### Program Description
                
The program is written in Java and prompts the user to input a number. It then determines the appropriate range for the next number based on the input. The program follows these steps:
                
1. Prompt the user to input a number.
2. Read the number from the standard input.
3. Determine the range for the next number based on the input. The range is calculated using some predefined logic or conditions.
4. Print out the range for the next number to be provided.
                
### Prerequisites
                
- Java Development Kit (JDK) should be installed on your machine.
 - A command-line interface or an IDE to compile and run the Java program.
                
 ### Usage
                
Follow the steps below to run the program:
                
 1. Compile the Java program:
 ```
   javac Main.java
 ```
                
2. Run the program:
 ```
 java Main
```

If you want to run the file through a script.sh, you may need to change the contents of the script.sh, more detailed instructions are in the script.sh in the comments (just uncomment the code you need)
